## Proposal 
1. Problem Area:
My area of interest is detecting severe injuries and active internal bleeding in abdominal organs, particularly focusing on blunt force abdominal trauma. This presents a critical challenge in emergency medicine as prompt diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment.

2. User and Benefits:
The stakeholders impacted by these challenges include emergency medicine doctors and nurses, ED administrators, surgeons, radiologists, and, most importantly, patients who have experienced blunt force abdominal trauma, often as a result of motor vehicle accidents. The project's outcomes hold the potential to significantly enhance their experience by enabling faster and more precise diagnoses, ultimately increasing the likelihood of a positive recovery.
3.Impact:
The potential impact of this project is significant. Efficiently detecting and classifying injuries can lead to expedited treatment, potentially saving lives in emergency situations. Additionally, it can reduce the overall cost of healthcare by minimizing the time spent on diagnosis and treatment planning. This could translate to substantial savings in healthcare expenses, as well as an improvement in the quality of life for affected individuals.
4. Data Source:
